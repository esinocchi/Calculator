# Python Calculator Application

This is a Python-based calculator application designed to prioritize both usability and computational efficiency. The application handles a wide range of mathematical expressions and efficiently computes results, making it ideal for users who need a reliable and fast tool for mathematical operations.

## Features

- **Usability Focused**: Built with the user in mind, ensuring an intuitive and seamless experience for performing various mathematical operations.
  
- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: 
  - The application uses stacks to convert mathematical expressions from infix notation to postfix (Reverse Polish) notation, simplifying the process of evaluating complex expressions.
  - This conversion increases the efficiency of the computation and minimizes errors when handling operator precedence and parentheses.

- **Efficient Postfix Evaluation**: 
  - The calculator efficiently computes results for postfix expressions, leveraging the stack structure to process operators and operands in the correct sequence.

- **Advanced Data Structures**:
  - **Queues**: Used to manage input sequences and operations in an organized manner, supporting the applicationâ€™s responsiveness.
  - **Hash Tables**: Employed to store and retrieve constants, functions, and user-defined variables in constant time, enhancing the overall speed and functionality of the calculator.
